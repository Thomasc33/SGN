Skeleton File Information
==================================================

Skeleton files used for all visualizations:

Indexing: All IDs are 0-indexed (starting from 0)

Sample 1:
  Original filename: S004C003P008R002A033.skeleton
  Actor ID: 7 (0-indexed, original: P008)
  Action ID: 32 (0-indexed, original: A033)
  Label from h5: 6
  Setup ID: 3 (0-indexed, original: S004)
  Camera ID: 2 (0-indexed, original: C003)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Sample 2:
  Original filename: S007C001P001R001A014.skeleton
  Actor ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: P001)
  Action ID: 13 (0-indexed, original: A014)
  Label from h5: 41
  Setup ID: 6 (0-indexed, original: S007)
  Camera ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: C001)
  Replication ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: R001)

Sample 3:
  Original filename: S008C003P031R002A047.skeleton
  Actor ID: 30 (0-indexed, original: P031)
  Action ID: 46 (0-indexed, original: A047)
  Label from h5: 42
  Setup ID: 7 (0-indexed, original: S008)
  Camera ID: 2 (0-indexed, original: C003)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Sample 4:
  Original filename: S008C002P032R002A033.skeleton
  Actor ID: 31 (0-indexed, original: P032)
  Action ID: 32 (0-indexed, original: A033)
  Label from h5: 40
  Setup ID: 7 (0-indexed, original: S008)
  Camera ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: C002)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Sample 5:
  Original filename: S006C002P017R001A012.skeleton
  Actor ID: 16 (0-indexed, original: P017)
  Action ID: 11 (0-indexed, original: A012)
  Label from h5: 19
  Setup ID: 5 (0-indexed, original: S006)
  Camera ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: C002)
  Replication ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: R001)

Legend:
  S = Setup ID (recording setup)
  C = Camera ID (camera viewpoint)
  P = Performer/Actor ID (person performing the action)
  R = Replication ID (repetition number)
  A = Action ID (action class)

Note: In the original NTU dataset, IDs in filenames are 1-indexed,
but in the processed data they are converted to 0-indexed for ML purposes.

Privacy Attribution Analysis:
The Actor ID is crucial for privacy attribution analysis as it represents
the identity that the re-identification model tries to predict.
