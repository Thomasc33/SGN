Skeleton File Information
==================================================

Skeleton files used for all visualizations:

Indexing: All IDs are 0-indexed (starting from 0)

Sample 1:
  Original filename: S008C002P015R002A010.skeleton
  Actor ID: 14 (0-indexed, original: P015)
  Action ID: 9 (0-indexed, original: A010)
  Label from h5: 27
  Setup ID: 7 (0-indexed, original: S008)
  Camera ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: C002)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Sample 2:
  Original filename: S003C001P007R002A017.skeleton
  Actor ID: 6 (0-indexed, original: P007)
  Action ID: 16 (0-indexed, original: A017)
  Label from h5: 29
  Setup ID: 2 (0-indexed, original: S003)
  Camera ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: C001)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Sample 3:
  Original filename: S007C001P017R001A009.skeleton
  Actor ID: 16 (0-indexed, original: P017)
  Action ID: 8 (0-indexed, original: A009)
  Label from h5: 26
  Setup ID: 6 (0-indexed, original: S007)
  Camera ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: C001)
  Replication ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: R001)

Sample 4:
  Original filename: S001C001P006R002A036.skeleton
  Actor ID: 5 (0-indexed, original: P006)
  Action ID: 35 (0-indexed, original: A036)
  Label from h5: 21
  Setup ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: S001)
  Camera ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: C001)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Sample 5:
  Original filename: S005C001P021R002A043.skeleton
  Actor ID: 20 (0-indexed, original: P021)
  Action ID: 42 (0-indexed, original: A043)
  Label from h5: 10
  Setup ID: 4 (0-indexed, original: S005)
  Camera ID: 0 (0-indexed, original: C001)
  Replication ID: 1 (0-indexed, original: R002)

Legend:
  S = Setup ID (recording setup)
  C = Camera ID (camera viewpoint)
  P = Performer/Actor ID (person performing the action)
  R = Replication ID (repetition number)
  A = Action ID (action class)

Note: In the original NTU dataset, IDs in filenames are 1-indexed,
but in the processed data they are converted to 0-indexed for ML purposes.

Privacy Attribution Analysis:
The Actor ID is crucial for privacy attribution analysis as it represents
the identity that the re-identification model tries to predict.
